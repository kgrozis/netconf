Title    -  1.3 Keeping the Last N Items
Problem  -  Want to keep a limited history of the last few items seen during 
              iteration or during some other kind of processing
Solution -  Use collections.deque
'''

from collections import deque

def search(lines, pattern, history=5):
  previous_lines = deque(maxlen=history)
  for line in lines:
    if pattern in line:
      yield line, previous_lines
    previous_lines.append(line)

# Example use on a file
if __name__ == '__main__':
  with open('somefile.txt') as f:
    for line, prevlines in search(f, 'python', 5):
      for pline in prevlines:
        print(pline, end='')
      print(line, end='')
      print('-'*20)
